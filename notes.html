                    ...Found a large group of mechanism, similar to the huge walking machinery we previously found at the ruins of Gurabad...
                    ...The key parts missing in the "Gurabad samples" (excuse me for the rash name) have been found here. It may be possible to repair the machinery's automatic system...
                    ...Found an organization called Schwanenritter, and its existence may be confirmed by the legend of Ruins of Dahri...</p>

                    ...Collected a lot of components, these spare parts of the huge machine, if only I could figure out its working principle and manufacturing process...

                    ...Fiddling with these components almost caused a delay in my work. These exquisite mechanical parts have a unique and ingenious style, which is not likely to be found in the handcrafted artifacts under the rule of Archons. I am going to take them apart, and record the size and shape one by one...

                    ...Explored the jungle with Zandik. Its local biodiversity is impressive. Although the growing effects of The Withering in other areas have also affected this place, it has yet to pose a great threat... We discovered a few new micro-scarab species. I suppose I could name them "Nahidad Scarabs," which means "the Dendro Archon's Boon" — a good name, I'd say!

                    ...Zandik was attracted by the ancient machines left behind by some civilization here...
                    
                    ...He's young — handsome, too. But he's too rigid, and the research approach of his Darshan has nothing in common with Amurta. As a result, we have nothing to talk about even though we are exploring this place together. That's pretty annoying...
                    
                    ...Zandik and I discussed the traits of local plants and animals. We also exchanged views on their evolution models. We had a great time and decided to go on a picnic tonight...</p>

Otherwise, the whole team would be in serious trouble... ...The terrifying killing machine has stopped. Zandik insisted on bringing it back to the Akademiya to be disassembled and reverse-engineered. That was absolutely ridiculous! Sage Sharnama reprimanded him and removed him from the author list. ...We buried Dastur Sohreh and sent the wounded back. Looks like this field research has come to an end...

                    "An ancient, tattered paper with incomplete information written on it"

                    ...Previously at ███, we collected 3 dosages of common substances that had been exposed to The Withering. But as we approached this facility, they were all purified, with no traces of abnormality left. The reason is still unknown...

                    ...Collected 5 samples (class: human) in the nearby village. Subject III: male adult, 20–25 yrs old. Subject IV: female adult, 25–30 yrs old. Subjects V/VI/VII: 1 male child, 7–14 yrs old, 2 female children...

                    ...All juvenile subjects went missing after displaying hallucinatory symptoms. The subjects in question seemed to be communicating with their "imaginary friends" in secret. Said "friends" are likely to be a Ley Line/Elemental creature that inhabits the forest (Aranara?).

                    About Aranara According to the tales of the forestfolk, Aranara is a highly intelligent being (botanic creature?) that can travel freely between reality and dreams. They can even create dreams based on the fabric of real-world environments. Far-fetched though it may sound, the folklore is not without credibility. We should keep looking and try to obtain a living sample.
                    If we put them to good use, cognition, complex memories, and irrational fantasies shall become controllable variables with which we can alter human individuals. As for the controllable dream, it has huge potential for both civil and military applications, and might even elevate human intelligence to a whole new level.
                    If the plan goes well, mankind will obtain the power to conquer both reality and dream, and truly transcend the earthly boundaries we are born with.
                    (A large ink stain was splashed next to the period. It seems that the writer broke the pen as they wrote this line.)

                    Attached is the documentation of the folklore associated with the unverified creature, Aranara. This content is for reference only...

                    ...Subject IV, adult, body functions completely shut down, a large area of skin ██████, visceral ██████. COD: loss of blood.
                   Upon seeing Subject IV in a coma, Subject III (adult) resisted violently in panic before being forcibly subdued, which resulted in the cessation of the experiment. Current conclusion: The Withering contains an unknown substance that can induce (the word "unpredictable" has been crossed out) pathological skin mutations. More tests are needed to identify the pattern of said mutations...

                   ...Subject III, adult, body functions completely shut down, a medium area of skin ██████, visceral ██████, blood ████, too. COD: Extreme fear led to complications, which caused heart failure and multiple-organ failure.
                   This is a waste of resources. It is advisable to watch over the subjects' mental state in the next experiment and avoid exposing them to extreme environments...

Any further experiments must wait for another day...
                    ...The things that the sages call Suda's Flow are nothing but products of sedimentation caused by perturbation of the elements. To think that they would use these as the core of the seal... Laughable in the extreme...

I speculate that its pilot may have had to undergo modifications to their vestibular system, or wore specialized adhesive boots and gloves...
