                    (Someone seems to have burnt the contents in a hurry. Only a few words remain legible now.) ...Thank goodness, Zandik reacted quickly. Otherwise, the whole team would be in serious trouble... ...The terrifying killing machine has stopped. Zandik insisted on bringing it back to the Akademiya to be disassembled and reverse-engineered. That was absolutely ridiculous! Sage Sharnama reprimanded him and removed him from the author list. ...We buried Dastur Sohreh and sent the wounded back. Looks like this field research has come to an end...

                    "Someone seems to have burnt the contents in a hurry. Only a few words remain legible now."
                    ...Found a large group of mechanism, similar to the huge walking machinery we previously found at the ruins of Gurabad...
                    ...The key parts missing in the "Gurabad samples" (excuse me for the rash name) have been found here. It may be possible to repair the machinery's automatic system...
                    ...Found an organization called Schwanenritter, and its existence may be confirmed by the legend of Ruins of Dahri...
