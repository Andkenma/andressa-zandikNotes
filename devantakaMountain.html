                    ...Explored the jungle with Zandik. Its local biodiversity is impressive. Although the growing effects of The Withering in other areas have also affected this place, it has yet to pose a great threat... We discovered a few new micro-scarab species. I suppose I could name them "Nahidad Scarabs," which means "the Dendro Archon's Boon" — a good name, I'd say!

                    ...Zandik was attracted by the ancient machines left behind by some civilization here...
                    
                    ...He's young — handsome, too. But he's too rigid, and the research approach of his Darshan has nothing in common with Amurta. As a result, we have nothing to talk about even though we are exploring this place together. That's pretty annoying...
                    
                    ...Zandik and I discussed the traits of local plants and animals. We also exchanged views on their evolution models. We had a great time and decided to go on a picnic tonight...

                    "A page from the research notes, but it seems to have been torn off and hidden here by the author."

                    ...Collected a lot of components, these spare parts of the huge machine, if only I could figure out its working principle and manufacturing process...

                    ...Fiddling with these components almost caused a delay in my work. These exquisite mechanical parts have a unique and ingenious style, which is not likely to be found in the handcrafted artifacts under the rule of Archons. I am going to take them apart, and record the size and shape one by one...
